App Idea: Personal Finance Tracker

This app would be a way for individuals to track their personal finances, including bills, expenses, 
and savings, in a more mindful way. Some of the features would be inputting expenses and income, 
setting a budget for different categories of spending, a progress bar to show how much a user has 
saved compared to their goal, the ability to write down goals and track progress towards them, 
displaying analytics in chart form to show trends in spending, and providing tips or reminders on 
how to be more financially successful. 

## Notes

One challenge I had was when adding the two buttons that change the font size. I had to figure out 
how to write the code that would change the value of the Label object's font size instead of doing 
it through the Utilities panel. At first I was only able to change the font size by 1 point, but 
then I realized I need to save the new value of the font size each time the function is called for 
it to keep increasing or decreasing.
